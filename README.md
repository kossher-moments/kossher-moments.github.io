Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is an open-source artificial intelligence created by OpenAI in February 2019.GPT-2 translates text, answers questions, summarizes passages, and generates text output on a level that, while sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans,can become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages.It is a general-purpose learner; it was not specifically trained to do any of these tasks, and its ability to perform them is an extension of its general ability to accurately synthesize the next item in an arbitrary sequence GPT-2 was created as a "direct scale-up" of OpenAI's 2018 GPT model, with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset.
